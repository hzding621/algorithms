# My Coding Solutions
These are my practice files for coding interview. The problems are mostly from  Gayle Laakmann McDowell's Cracking the Coding Interview (I am using Fourth version and the filename are just the problem numbers on the book) and LeetCode.com (for which I have included the links to the pages). 


Feel free to discuss the problems with me: <a href="mailto:hding8@illinois.edu">hding8@illinois.edu</a>
