/**
 * Each dsets object represents a family of disjoint sets, 
 * where each element has an integer index.
 *
 * It is implemented with the optimizations discussed in class, 
 * as up-trees stored in a single vector of ints. Specifically, 
 * path compression and union-by-size are used. Each place in the 
 * vector represents a node. (Note that this means that the elements 
 * in our universe are indexed starting at 0.) A nonnegative number 
 * is the index of the parent of the current node; a negative number 
 * in a root node is the negative of the set size.
 *
 * Note that the default compiler-supplied Big Five will work flawlessly 
 * because the only member data is a vector of integers and this vector 
 * should initially be empty.
